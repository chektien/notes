# Immersification: another dimension to learning design

## Motivation

As educators, other than being always on top of the content we're teaching, the next most important thing for students is in designing the learning environment.

Traditionally, learning design ... <something about different design considerations of learning design>

Studies have shown that being immersed in a particular kind of learning environment profoundly structures the learners’ “social knowledge, worldviews and moral principles that denote membership and status in a trade” Marchand, 2008, p. 246

Modern learning environments nowadays also include the use of Augmented Reality (AR)), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) \cite{some article to define this} to redefine learning environments, albeit often in an experimental fashion as the technologies are mostly still in their infancy. Business continuity requirements in preparation and response to natural calamities and pandemics have also spurred these exploration efforts into new ways to engage students remotely. 

In this article, we aim to introduce a design framework around the concept of _immersification_, a neologism we will coin here to refer to the application of immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR and MR) to enhance the user experience of activities.
cognitive dimension for educators to design learning environments.

## Gamification
Let's look at a similar word that was commissioned not too long ago, "gamification", or the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts to improve engagement. Gamification, now a word that is extremely commonplace, was reportedly only added to the Oxford dictionary in 2011 (Reyes).

## Immersification Continuum
Much like the virtuality continuum, the immersification continuum also serves as a design cognitive tool to aid the application of XR elements to the learning activities in question.
