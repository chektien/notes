# Immersification: a fresh dimension to learning design

## Motivation

As educators, other than being always on top of our content knowledge, the next most important quality is arguably the design of student learning environments (Marchand, 2008). As learning environments increasing include more virtual components, the role of technology in learning design becomes increasingly crucial (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007; Voogt et al., 2013). The benefits of technology-enhanced learning is certainly well-understood (Wang & Hannafin, 2005), but a heightened urgency to prepare and respond to unforeseen calamities and pandemics have also spurred exploration efforts into new ways to engage students remotely. 

Modern learning environments are beginning to include the use of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to redefine learning environments (Wu et al., 2013), albeit often in an experimental fashion as these technologies are mostly still in their infancy. Being a class of technologies that is less understood, we hope to use our experiences from the Singapore Institute of Technology to provide a fresh perspective to educators who are using, or thinking about using, immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR and MR) to enhance learning environments.

## Defining Immersification of Learning
In this article, we aim to introduce a learning technology design consideration around the concept of _immersification_, a neologism we will coin here to refer to the application of immersive technologies to engage users in alternate realities to enhance their digital media experiences.

// cognitive dimension for educators to design learning environments.

In many ways, we can draw similarities of _immersification_ with another recently crowned concept - _gamification_. It was not too long ago that gamification, just like the aforementioned immersification, was also a word that was flagged with red squiggly lines by spell-checkers in word processors.

Gamification, or the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts to improve engagement, is widely popular in learning contexts. Gamification, now a word that is extremely commonplace, was reportedly only defined added to the Oxford dictionary in 2011 (Deterding et al., 2011; Drell, 2011) due to it's widespread proliferation.

With the increasing demand for activities to go online, we see a similar trajectory in applying immersive technologies to improve these online activities. Here we will focus on the immersification of learning.

## Immersification Continuum
Much like the virtuality continuum, the immersification continuum also serves as a design cognitive tool to aid the application of XR elements to the learning activities in question.

We certainly recognize the important prioritization order of "pedagogy before technology", and would need to clarify that we assume pedagogy design is a prerequisite to the technology design discussion in this article.
