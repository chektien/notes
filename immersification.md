# Immersification: a fresh dimension to learning design

## Motivation

As educators, other than being always on top of our content knowledge, the next most important quality is arguably the design of student learning environments (Marchand, 2008). As learning environments increasing include more virtual components, the role of technology in learning design becomes increasingly crucial (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007; Voogt et al., 2013). The benefits of technology-enhanced learning is certainly well-understood (Wang & Hannafin, 2005), but a heightened urgency to prepare and respond to unforeseen calamities and pandemics have also spurred exploration efforts into new ways to engage students remotely. 

Modern learning environments are beginning to include the use of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to redefine learning environments (Wu et al., 2013), albeit often in an experimental fashion as these technologies are mostly still in their infancy. Being a class of technologies that is less understood, we hope to use our experiences from the Singapore Institute of Technology to provide a fresh perspective to educators who are using, or thinking about using, immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR and MR) to enhance learning environments.

## Defining Immersification of Learning
In this article, we aim to introduce a design consideration for learning technology around the concept of _immersification_, a neologism we will coin here to refer to the application of immersive technologies to engage users in alternate realities to enhance their digital media experiences.

In many ways, we can draw similarities of _immersification_ with another recently crowned concept - _gamification_. It was not too long ago that gamification, similar to the aforementioned immersification, was also a word that was flagged with \squiggly{red squiggly lines} by spell-checkers in word processors.

Gamification, or the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts to improve engagement, is now a word that is extremely commonplace. However, the word gamification was reportedly only defined (Deterding et al., 2011) and added to the Oxford dictionary (Drell, 2011) in 2011 due to it's widespread proliferation. Gamification has also enjoyed much success in learning contexts (DomíNguez et al., 2013).

We think that the concept of immersification may be heading towards a similar trajectory if the increasing demand for activities to go online continues. It is hence timely to start formulating some cognitive theory around immersification in the context of learning.

## Immersification Continuum
The initial step to any form of learning design certainly involves some form of requirements analysis and identification of learning objectives. Assuming  those steps are completed, the educator then needs to design the instructional approach, and this is where we hope to add value by introducing a cognitive design tool which we call the _immersification continuum_ (Figure 1). The tool is intentionally kept simple and serves as a single-dimensional scale to help educators decide what forms of immersive technology to use. Simply put, the scale helps educators decide how immersive they want the learning experiences should be with respect to the learning objectives.

For readers familiar with the AR/VR literature, this may appear to bear some similarities with the _reality-virtuality continuum_, and we certainly do not deny that we had drawn upon it for some inspiration for the immersification continuum. However, instead of conceptualising from the implementation aspects (i.e., how real vs virtual we want the outcome to be) in the reality-virtuality continuum, we propose for designers to think about the experiential aspects (i.e., what intensity of _experience_ we hope to enable for users of the technology) in the immersification continuum.

## Applying the Immersification Continuum 
To demonstrate applications of the immersification continuum, several examples of immersification at SIT will be used here.

Note that the concept of the continuum was conceived mainly as a result of consolidating all the immersification work done at SIT. However, for the purpose of discussion, we have picked several of these work as case studies to retrospectively demonstrate how to use the continuum.

The immersification continuum is deliberately conceived in a way that can be intuitively understood (at least that is what we hoped). Simply put, it serves as a way to remind educators that some thought needs to be dedicated to deciding **how immersive** the intended experience should be, depending on the learning requirements and objectives.

We wish to emphasize that the continuum is not meant to be a gauge to assess he "goodness" of an immersification implementation, although it may be tempting to view the scale in this manner. In other words, more immersiveness (i.e., to the right side of the continuum) does not equate to a better learning experiences, although for some circumstances it may well be.

As mentioned, usage of the continuum should come after (or hand-in-hand with) learning requirements and objectives. This relationship can also often be mediated by practical concerns like developmental resources, for example, the usual time and budget constraints.

To illustrate these usage guidelines, let us look at how some learning designs from SIT landed on different parts of the immersification continuum.

### High Immersiveness: VR Pre-Labs
<talk about VRBioreactor in PHE module>

### Medium Immersiveness: Interactive 360 Video Lectures
<talk about ICT2x01 cycling>

### Low Immersiveness: Video Lectures
The learning context here is a semester module for _Software Management_. The immersification outcome here is a set of video lectures on the concept of Agile Scrum practices in managing software projects. The specific learning objective (out of a broader set of objectives) in question was to **differentiate between** various software management methods. It is important to differentiate this with the previous example in "VR Pre-Labs" that aims to let students **practice** the operation of bioreactors. Hence the appropriate immersification technique here would be to use video lectures. 

Hence we can start by placing our decision point close to the extreme left end of the continuum. Of course, the continuum is not meant to be exact science and hence there is no need to establish any accuracy or derive any specific values from the scale, at least at this stage of developing the continuum. 

Continuing along the cognitive decision trajectory using the continuum, we had another input that can affect our immersification decisions, and that is the overarching learning pedagogy of SIT, to facilitate **applied learning** as widely as possible. If you had looked closer at the video content, they were based on an real-world funded software project that involved actual stakeholders. This demonstrates another way to view the continuum. Rather than isolating _technological approach_ as the only independent variable affecting the level of immersiveness, other factors like the _nature of content_ delivered by the technology also plays at part in moving the point on the scale.

## Conclusion

We certainly recognize the important prioritization order of "pedagogy before technology", and would need to clarify that we assume pedagogy design is a prerequisite to the technology design discussion in this article.
