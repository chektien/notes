# Immersification: another dimension to learning design

## Motivation

As educators, other than being always on top of the content knowledge we're teaching, the next most important thing for student learning is in designing the learning environment. As learning environments increasing include more virtual components, the role of technology in learning design becomes increasingly crucial (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007; Voogt et al., 2013).

Studies have shown that being immersed in a particular kind of learning environment profoundly structures the learners’ “social knowledge, worldviews and moral principles that denote membership and status in a trade” Marchand, 2008, p. 246

Modern learning environments nowadays also include the use of Augmented Reality (AR)), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to redefine learning environments (Wu et al., 2013), albeit often in an experimental fashion as these technologies are mostly still in their infancy. Business continuity requirements in preparation and response to natural calamities and pandemics have also spurred exploration efforts into new ways to engage students remotely. 

In this article, we aim to introduce an e-learning technology design consideration around the concept of _immersification_, a neologism we will coin here to refer to the application of immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR and MR) to engage users in alternate realities to enhance their digital media experiences.

// cognitive dimension for educators to design learning environments.

## Gamification
In many ways, we can draw similarities of _immersification_ with another recently crowned concept - _gamification_. It was not too long ago that gamification, just like the aforementioned immersification, was also a word that was flagged with red squiggly lines by spell-checkers in word processors.

Gamification, or the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts to improve engagement, is widely popular in learning contexts. Gamification, now a word that is extremely commonplace, was reportedly only added to the Oxford dictionary in 2011 (Reyes) due to it's widespread proliferation.

With the increasing demand for activities to go online, we see a similar trajectory in applying immersive technologies to improve these online activities. Here we will focus on the immersification of learning.

## Immersification Continuum
Much like the virtuality continuum, the immersification continuum also serves as a design cognitive tool to aid the application of XR elements to the learning activities in question.

We certainly recognize the important prioritization order of "pedagogy before technology", and would need to clarify that we assume pedagogy design is a prerequisite to the technology design discussion in this article.
