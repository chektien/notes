Proposed way forward for SMRT collaboration
===========================================

We think all the projects listed by SMRT share the common problems we aim to address in the Centre for Immersification. The two key capabilities we are developing will focus on making it more accessible, usable and scalable to create and use immersive technologies.

In particular, all of SMRT projects require intensive resources to create the AR/VR/MR virtual environments and will need for the developers to implement novel interaction mechanisms that, e.g., allow trainees to have effectve training experience.

### What SMRT can put on the table

-   EOM for co-developing research horizontals that benefit all XR projects in SMRT

    -   work towards immersification in LTA and subsequently transport industry globally?

        -   need to discuss whether open to open-sourcing and benefiting all in the community

            -   EOM roles can be purely advisory

                -   only commitment is to attend Immersive Roundtable every month

                ### What SIT can put on the table

                -   provide the community platform for capability training from SIT and all the core IHL + Industry partners in this space

                -   provide access to share EQT resources

                -   further opportunities for academic-led funding for individual projects

                -   already collaborating with SIT on several ongoing and future projects
