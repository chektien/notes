## New space for immersification centre

1. The capability development plan includes 9 Research Engineers, and 2 new Research Fellows. There will be constant communication and frequent casual meetings between them. If they are in a space shared with POs and other REs, we think it will be rather disruptive both ways.

2. Workstation spaces need to be located close to or next to the development spaces for testing and productivity for XR development. Separate floors will not be suitable.

3. Co-location of all spaces on the same floor will improve accessibility and visibility for external visitors. The centre will hold regular events with the industry and external organizations. The glass door pace also enhances the centres image to visitors.

4. Yes student interns will not have entry to the new space if it is to remain designated as a staff-only space.

## Jolynn’s comments

I am looking at the request for space for your proposed project.
 
Level 4 office areas have been earmarked for staff expansion for Faculty. As RE and RF are categorized as PO, the allocated spaces will be at Level 6. We will have to engage further with PVO and other stakeholders as this deviates from the earlier discussion.

## Responses

>> 17 Dec: Research staff will fall under category of PO and thus use the Level 6 earmarked spaces. Student interns will have to work within the SR4H/J space as they should not gain access to staff office areas. Ok?

>> We are still keen to pursue that space for the following reasons:

Hi Jolynn,

Sorry for the late response and thanks for considering our requests and facilitating further conversations. I’m not sure how far back were the said earlier discussions, but this “Centre for Immersification” proposal is certainly a step up from the “AXR Lab” space request proposal at AG Exco some time ago.

> 1. Would casual meetings likely be held in specific meeting rooms or at development spaces?
> 2. Noted the need for workstation space and development space to be close by. Can I check why separate floors will not suitable, ie 2 floors away but within the same building?

The casual meetings will be in both the workstations and development spaces. Perhaps “meeting” is not the best word to use here. These are mainly referring to deeper unplanned discussions that frequently occur in our work, e.g., oftentimes a casual question turns into a technical discussion on the whiteboard as we try to explain/explore the code algorithms. In general it is simply having a more a conducive interactive space for tech developers who create software that have various levels of dependencies and interactions between them. The development work is highly integrated with the hardware and proximity to the lab will be really helpful for productivity.

To provide a bit more prior context, I spoke with Edward on how the ideal case is for the office space to be converted into an open working space that can be slightly more configurable, but we concluded that perhaps the effort and costs required to achieve that may not be worth it as we only have a couple more years before punggol. We can certainly make the best of what we have now.

> 3. It seems that it is intended to use the Level 4 office as a “permanent Centre space”? Then can other faculty be located within?

In case there is some misunderstanding, the L4 office area has 2 office spaces that have separate glass door entrances. The large one on the right is already being used as a faculty office and we are not suggesting to touch that. We are proposing to use the one on the left which is currently used as storage for spare classroom furniture. And yes we are hoping to use that as a permanent Centre space until further development. 

Let me know if we need a zoom call to clarify things.

> Noted your comments on the discussions which may be done within the lab and office spaces.
> Like to clarify that both Level 4 offices are meant for faculty seating, the storage is a temporary arrangement. Some considerations on usage of the Level 4 office include: by allowing the 9 RE and 2 RF to sit at the available space, if the space runs out, who is to ask them to leave so that the intended occupants new faculty)( could occupy the space. The precedents that would be set once other faculty hear of it.) \#\# additional
