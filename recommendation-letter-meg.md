To Whom It May Concern:

The purpose of this note is to serve as a recommendation letter for Ms Megadino Rajendran.

I am an Associate Professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and currently hold the position of Centre Director at the Centre for Immersification, a research centre in SIT. I have known Ms Megani for about 1.5 years (2020-2021) both as an instructor to her in a software engineering undergraduate module and as her work supervisor in her internship with our research projects in immersive technologies.

Ms Megani has constantly shown genuine interest in the deep technical tasks in our research projects, which includes complex computer graphics programming, employing machine learning algorithms for segmentation of 3D point clouds, and soon full stack mobile development.

As a team player, Ms Megani is proactive in providing feedback for task review sessions for other team members. She also often volunteers to help in tasks that are not assigned to her or even within her domain of expertise.

As a person, she is always polite and shows respect for others. In general, she possesses a pleasant personality and I always enjoy having her presence in conversations.

In all, I have no reservations recommending Ms Megani for a software engineering or developer position that is technically demanding. I am confident that she will perform well in her future endeavours given my interactions with her.
