# Immersification: industry colab strategy

# IMDA 

## Current problems that we hear from previous discussions
- PIXEL coys are mostly budget-tight
  - hard to purchase/update equipment
  - unable to license IP
  - etc
- PIXEL coys have also limited academic partnerships
- need educators to provide training for the community

## Collaboration possibilities

### What IMDA can  put on the table
- serve as the mediator to help facilitate the relationships between companies and SIT
  - in-kind EOM for coordination, legal etc...
- co-organize the Immersions event (potentially merge with existing event, e.g., Innovation Thursdays)
  - in-kind provision of venue
  - in-kind EOM organizational effort
- individual partnerships with PIXEL coys to be determined on a case by case basis 
  - e.g., combined EOM/EQT/EOM towards co-developing horizontal capabilities in the interaction and simulation layers

### What SIT can put on the table
- provide capability training related to immersive technologies
- provide PIXEL coys with first-hand access to IP created from the research horizontals
- provide PIXEL coys access to our eqpt sharing platform
- provide access to academic-led funding opportunities with PIXEL coys

### WHY SIT
- interactions with other ongoing partnerships with IMDA (5G)
- well-positioned for IP sharing
- pool of industry-focused academics
- KPIs aligned with IMDA PIXELâ€™s, e.g., 
  - growing Immersive Media capabilities in Singapore
  - industry impact as priority
  - growing community
- specialized in T&L, and particularly endorse applied learning, workplace learning

# SMRT

## Collaboration possibilities
### What SMRT can put on the table
- EOM for co-developing research horizontals that benefit all XR projects in SMRT
  - work towards immersification in LTA and subsequently transport industry globally?
  - need to discuss whether open to open-sourcing and benefiting all in the community
  - EOM roles can be purely advisory
  - only commitment is to attend Immersive Roundtable every month

### What SIT can put on the table
- provide the community platform for capability training from SIT and all the core IHL + Industry partners in this space
- provide access to share EQT resources
- further opportunities for academic-led funding for individual projects
- already collaborating with SIT on several ongoing and future projects

## Aviation Virtual

### Problem
- need to be remunerated for their efforts

###

Have IMDA PIXEL tenants be involved in 
- roundtable at their premise 
- framework of in-kind contributions
- in-kind from them to tackle problems
- centre boils down to individual projects
- equipment companies provide in-kind
- showcase as in-kind for pixel, booth space
- software tools vendors
unique equipment
ACSL -> NYP -> punggol
