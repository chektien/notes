Proposed way forward for SMRT collaboration
===========================================

We think all the projects listed by SMRT share the common problems we aim to address in the Centre for Immersification. The two key capabilities we are developing will focus on making it more accessible, usable and scalable to create and use immersive technologies.

In particular, all of SMRT projects require intensive resources to create the AR/VR/MR virtual environments and will need for the developers to implement novel interaction mechanisms that, e.g., allow trainees to have effectve training experience.


## Collaboration plans 

### What SMRT can put on the table

## Base Package:

Supporting the Centre's development of research horizontals
  - benefits the broader community
  - outcomes will aid the creation and use of immersive tech
  - in turn benefits XR projects in SMRT
  - potentially open-source to benefit all in the community

## Pro Package:

Co-development of tools that can specifically benefit a number of XR projects in SMRT
  - will require cash contribution for the dedicated resources required


## Potential contribution forms:

1. Cash 
  - mainly for 1.

2. In-kind EQT

3. In-kind EOM
  - roles can be mainly advisory and light on workload
  - only commitment is to attend Immersive Roundtable regularly


### What SIT can put on the table

- provide the community platform for capability training from SIT and all the core IHL + Industry partners in this space
- provide access to shared EQT resources, e.g., LiDAR scanners (\$60k), Valve Index
- further opportunities for academic-led funding for individual projects

## Releasing an Immersification Platform, example features:

- locomotion component
- XR lecture projection UI
- assessment tools (e.g., XR quizzes)
- telemetry components (e.g., logging of actions, positions, etc)

### RMDP THI proposal
- how about SGRAIL scholarship potential
